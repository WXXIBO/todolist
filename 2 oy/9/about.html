              highlighting stories of coffee from around the world. We have
              since been dedicated to bring the perfect cup - from bean to brew
              - in every shipment

            <h1>OUR COMMITED</h1>
            <p>
              We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good
              along the way. We want to make it easy for you to discover and
              brew the world’s best coffee at home. It all starts at the source.
              To locate the specific lots we want to purchase, we travel nearly
              60 days a year trying to understand the challenges and
              initiatives, and invest in coffee plant science. Curating only the
              finest blends, we roast each lot to highlight tasting profiles
              distinctive to their native growing region.

                </h1>
                <p>
                    Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of harvest and processing, we employ, on our end, a rigorous quality control program to avoid over-roasting or baking the coffee dry. Every bag of coffee is tagged with a roast date and batch number. Our goal is to roast consistent, user-friendly coffee, so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.
